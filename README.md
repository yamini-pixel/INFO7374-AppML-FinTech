## Description

Machine learning has had fruitful applications in finance well before the advent of mobile banking apps, proficient chat bots, or search engines. This class is designed to teach introductory machine learning techniques as applied in finance. The course combines methodology with theoretical foundations and computational aspects. The focus of the course is on implementation rather than theory. It treats both the art of financial intuition and the science of realizing algorithms in Python. Students will learn implementing algorithms and solving real-world problems faced by quants, market
makers and portfolio managers.
